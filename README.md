A Xcode Plug-in imitating the activate-power-mode atom package. Shake &amp; Spark effect included.

Default color is white for black editor background color. Some settings (like changing color of the effect) can be found under Xcode's Edit Menu.

Just a buggy version with simple visual effect. Hope I will update it continually..
